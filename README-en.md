PLS3DCH
        <p>This mod pack is the result of the work of a small team of enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>We have put a lot of effort into making the Plasticity interface more convenient and functional. However, as this is an unofficial modification, errors and bugs may occur. By using this build, you accept that everything is unstable and may break.</p>
        <h4>Recommendations for setting up Plasticity:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In the settings, it's better to disable automatic command invocation (Invoke off) for the function parameter saving mod to work correctly.</li>
            <li>Do not point the Asset-browser to folders with huge nested structures; it will dig in there, find undesirable things, freeze, and die. Simply from an overabundance of files.</li>
            <li>Don't play with the buttons; you'll get hooked.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It would be good to make sure your Plasticity settings file is also updated.</p>
